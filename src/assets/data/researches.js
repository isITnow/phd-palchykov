          "Cyclic sulfoxides and sulfones are important pharmacophores with a wide range of pharmacological activities owing to a range of mechanisms of action and are widely used in drug design [Adv. Het. Chem. 2021, 134, 1-30]. The cyclic sulfone moiety is frequently utilized in medicinal chemistry to optimize the physicochemical properties of lead compounds. The polarity associated with both sulfones and sulfoxides helps to lower the overall lipophilicity which in many cases translates into improvements in ADME and pharmaceutical properties. There are many examples of commercial drugs and clinical candidates containing six-membered thiopyrane ring. Depending on the substitution pattern of the core thiopyrane ring, this class of compounds has demonstrated a diverse range of biological activities ranging from anti-inflammatory and antiviral to ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP) openers. Many compounds are now under active investigation as selective inhibitors of different enzymes and kinases, and agonists/antagonists of receptors. Antiglaucoma agent Dorzolamide, diuretic Metikran and antiherpesvirus agent Amenamevir (ASP-2151) became marketed drugs",

          "We turned our attention to β-ketosulfones since they have been established as versatile reagents useful for the preparation of a multitude of sulfur-containing compounds both synthetic and biological importance. In this context, cyclic β-ketosulfones are among the most promising reagents and particularly useful due to their availability and possible application in the synthesis of a diverse range of polycyclic sulfones. We are currently working on a green, mild, and scalable synthesis of S-heterocycles depicted below",

        description:
          "Compounds with unusual three-dimensional structures have frequently attracted the attention of chemists as possible synthetic targets because the shape of chemical structures in drug discovery is a crucial component for evoking molecular recognition events with biological targets. Medicinal chemists typically exploit novel conformationally restricted 3D-shaped building blocks with a high fraction of C(sp3)-hybridized carbons (Fsp3). Polycyclic cage compounds have important pharmaceutical applications, ranging from the symptomatic and proposed curative treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, to use as antiviral agents against influenza and the immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The polycyclic cage appears to be a useful scaffold to yield drugs with a wide scope of applications and can be used also to modify and improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs in current use.",

          "It is not surprising, therefore, that currently medicinal chemists are increasingly searching for novel, unique, 3D-shaped, and conformationally restricted screening compounds. Thus, cage-like molecules are attractive for the drug discovery in terms of modern medical chemistry and new concepts, and therefore we set out to design and synthesize such derivatives that would be of interest as potential anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-fungal and anti-cancer agents. One of the best motifs in our chemistry are the various epoxynorbornanes, which give a wide range of interesting cage derivatives. ",
